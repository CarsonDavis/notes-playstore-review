# Chapter 3: Immortal Coils

Dawkins introduces DNA as the modern **replicator** — the molecule that has survived billions of years by making copies of itself.

## Key Ideas

- Genes are the units of natural selection, not individuals or species
- A gene is defined as *any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection*
- Sexual reproduction shuffles genes each generation, but individual genes persist across many bodies

## Quotes

> "We are survival machines — robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."

The chapter builds the case that **longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity** are the three qualities that make a successful replicator.
